# GameGo – Video Game Store Management System

## Description of the Project

GameGo is a RESTful backend application designed to simulate an online video game store. The system allows users to browse video games by category, manage a shopping cart, place orders, and track inventory. The backend is built using Java Spring Boot and connects to a MySQL database to persist store data.

This project models a real-world e-commerce platform focused on video game sales and backend business logic.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to view available video games, so I can browse products in the store.

- As a user, I want to view games by category, so I can easily find what I’m looking for.

- As a user, I want to add games to a shopping cart, so I can prepare an order before checkout.

- As a user, I want to place an order, so I can purchase the games in my cart.

- As a user, I want my order to update inventory automatically, so stock levels stay accurate.

- As a user, I want to view my order details, so I can confirm my purchase.

- As a user, I want reliable feedback from the system, so I know my actions were successful.
